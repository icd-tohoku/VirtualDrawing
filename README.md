# VirtualDrawing

## Introduction
This project will cover how to heighten the drawing experience in Virtual Reality. To this end, we will be looking at various scenarios, which will augment the drawing actions the user inputs. As the user draws characters or text, the virtual surface will move accordingly. That way the user will not have to change his hand positioning, which should be benefitial for the virtual experience. Additionally we will implement a scalable surface, which will augment the users input by scaling it according to a factor. 

## Scenario I Non-augmented Text
To find out if our text augmentation leads to a better drawing experience, we first need to establish the experience without said augmentation. The scenario includes a drawable surface on top of a table. The user is not limited in what text or pictures he is supposed to draw (*subject to change*).

## Scenario II
